This app was based on an assignment in the Coursera deep learning specialization on convolutional networks. It uses a pre-trained VGG-19 convolutional neural network to merge the content of one image with the style of a second image. The app uses gradient descent to optimize the pixels of the generated image.

The code is available [here](https://github.com/stuarthaze/StyleTransferApp)
