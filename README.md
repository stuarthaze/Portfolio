This app was based on an assignment in the Coursera deep learning specialization. It uses a pre-trained VGG-19 convolutional neural network to merge the content of one image with the style of a second image. Gradient descent is used to optimize the pixels of the generated image. The app was built using streamlit.

The code is available [here](https://github.com/stuarthaze/StyleTransferApp)
